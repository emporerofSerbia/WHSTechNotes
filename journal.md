One way technology can be used to help teachers adapt to new language is by scanning for new BUZZ words. It can just randomly go through popular social media, perhaps check with the owner to go into videos tailored and shared to younger kids, and check for any new or out of place words. It can give a decent defintion of the word, or as best as it can do, and the teacher can use their own context clue to fill in the rest. Ways this could beneift the kids and teachers is by curbing bullying, or finding out what message is encoded into the new weird words. Like goon in the dictionary means like a thug or lackey, but in pop-culture, it means to masturbate (WHAT).

I'd start by feeding it every play ever made in proffessional football so it can start to see what really works, what plays on average, score the best in their certain environments. Applicating would need the stats of every one of your players and the stats of the team they're going against. 
It could be able to calculate whether letting a person run for a touchdown is a good play, depending on the enemy players around him and they're speeds, whether they'd be able to intercept. It could quickly find the weakpoints of your team like speed or weight.

Today, there are WAY too many planes in the air for a human to be able to make sure nothing crashes, so automation is a must. All a pilot does is a follow a pre-set flight path, a path set by a computer. It's already supposed to be impervious to tragedy, yet here we are. Maybe the military copter wasn't bound to a path, being for military, or maybe there was just an error.
Purposeful human interference is a real thing and is a big reason why there's still a pilot on all air planes. Maybe we can have 2 computer programms on every plane, and if the first one starts deviating for the set flight path, the second one, (probably set with more authority), can just completely take over. Maybe we can coat all computer decision making objects with a thin layer of copper, (copper blocks jamming signals), and mabually open it when the plane wants to send a signal.

I think the government intervention at TikTok showed the flaws when it comes to decisions made by the Supreme Court. They aren't scientists, no mathmeticians, no logicians, no technology experts. They can handle most cases when it comes to most things, but for things they don't know about? Things like data-security in TikTok, they are WORTHLESS!!!! I don't even use TikTok and I could tell how unfair that court meeting was. I believe the Supreme Court should have a subsect of Supreme Advisors, who tell them whats going on for things they can't possibly understand.

I am SCARED of ai. I'm thinking of switching career plans because I've heard every argument for computer science, how "we still need programmers to make the ai" and "programmers are stil relavant now" and yeah thats true. They may be safe for another 20 years but what about 40? 50? Is this a career that's safe for the rest of my life, or will I be homeless at the age of 40? I DONT KNOW!!!! AND NO ONE REALLY DOES!!!!!!

I enjoyed most how easy the class was, and how I could work on my freakishly hard assignments from cs3 during this period it really helped. Something to be improved is how bright this monitor is. I hope I can figure out how to dim it in the future.
I would love to learn how to iterate through a maze in java, Mr. Fenoglio gave us a bunch of these problems and he gave us the solution but its like a quadruple for-loop with 8 cases of recursion I just can't take it, no one in my class has even been able to touch it.
I want to pursure the Python certification because it's super easy and fun. My friend (no prior Python knowledge) studied Python for like 20 minutes and passed the certificationg course so I'm excited for it. I would just want the mini-course and the test.

IM SO EXCITED FOR WINTER BREAK!!!!!!1!1!1!1! School has been kicking my ass recenntly with all these stupid ap's and i NEEEEEED a break. I NEEEEEED A BREAK PLEAASSEE. I WANT TOOO LIVE!!!!!! I have to use the time to catch up on all my CS work because some of it, genuinly, is so hard. I need some time to look up the answer and just analyze everything about it and learn all I can. He dropped a bunch of these "maze problems" about iterating through a maze and he also gave us the answer, but the pure algorithm just for iterating through the maze is like 100 LINES OF CODE of turning spaces to hashtags and finding the fastest way through the maze without a time complexity of O(n!); I NEEEED THIS BREAK.

Brain rot, I think comes from humor as it's evolved to children, plus new ai and computer generated videos. They're alright I guess. We shoudl limit screen time, or atleast force companies to make a way to toggle their short-form videos because that's something I want. Sometimes after a really depressing day on the phone, I feel brain fog. I can't think well, I can't do anything well. I HATE IT. I hate the phone it's cool for calling your friends but everything else NO. 
I bet Lebron never watched short-form videos and look at him now. We need to stop this.

One way AI has been advancing is in study material. Theres this website, I forgot the name, but it takes a picture of your school notes and generates a talk between two people about these notes, covering every niche subject 
possible. This is CRAZY for memoriuzing notes because you can play it WHEREVER and whenever!!!!! I love it, so much easier and better than rereading or blurting out notes.

We might be celebrating Thanksgiving next week, but only maybe. I personally bomb an orphanage every Thanksgiving so that the children can be thankful before I take EVERYTHING away. But in popular
culture, Thanksgiving is coming.

1. A U.S airliner was struck by gunfire while going over Haitian borders. This relates to our class because had their data-solving, enemy bomber analyzer been working, it wouldn't have tried to fire down a U.S comercial airline.
2. Things like A.I could utylize adaptive pattern recognition to find out what is safe and what isn't, being reliable even through the test of time.

1. It's vital to protect your information when publishing online. Your sensitive information can be used against you to access things like your bank account, social security, and do reveal private things you don't want revealed.
2. Steps taken to prevent the release of your personal data are things like a password. Multi-factor authentification especially is a great way to ensure your account won't be hacked for a long time.
3. This one time I shared with my friends a picture of this dog, but my feet were in frame. They took screenshot after screenshot, and even after i deleted the picture, my feet may never be truely secret again.
4. Balancing being open while still keeping your htings private can be achieved with things like a public account. The account will only have things you don't really care if they get hacked. No secret passwords, private anything in the account, so that you can use it freely without fear if getting exposed.

Technology could greatly expand the reach that polling could go. Instead of having to put a station with police, a secure ticket stand, and a million ways to make sure people don't sneak in multiple tickets, we coudl have just throw down a polling booth and call it a day. The algorithm can be tried and tried again to be infallible, it's way cheaper, and can make accurately counting the vote way easier. However, scams and hacking become a big fear with this. Many people have accused the 2016 and 2020 elections robbed, with both sides fearing the other interefering with the machines.

AI will be a major help to programmers. Why make an entire least to greatest sorting code when ai can just copy and paste it in for you. It'll make all the typing a lot faster. We can mold it to our needs and make it perfect for everything we want
AI in the job market will slash the demand for our volume of programmers. Since makign the simple code is now easy, only the best of the best are needed for real algorithms an AI can't do yet. And with time, as AI gets better, the need for
more programmers will reach a bell curve.

1. Coding majorly helps problem solving through it's need for creative thinking. The basics of code are easy, but very just not human. If you wanna reverse a string or make palindromes, you're gonna have to make full use of your for-loops,
   and being to use them with full understanding. There's never a straight forward, one-step solution.
2. Knowing code helps you underatdn how the computer and software probably works. You can work with it when making spreadsheets, or even code your owb systems to automate your work.
3. Coding requires people to come together and think of genuinly insane way to solve problems. It needs that creativity, to use your crude tools to solve real world problems.

# October 7, 2024

1. Web developer
2. Create use and ergodynamic web sites for people
3. Bachelors degree, computer science degree, heavy experience and good home projects
4.  Bachelors degree, computer science degree, heavy experience and good home projects
5.  Expected growth of around 10% in ten years
6.  I like making intuitive and easy to use things, I like webistes in general, and i think we have a need for better ones.

Code isn't human. To talk to the machine, you need to language EXACTLY like how it wants. There can be no ambiguous, no unclear basis
that a human could just assume over. Following instruction exactly as they are given is vital to learning how to code. There are many ways to teach, but there is only really one exact thing to teach. English classes differ from America to Britain, each with their own slang and vernacular, but in coding, there is only one, PRECISE language.

Everyday for to start off my morning, I play wordle. It's not good for me, I know that much, but its latched onto me. I can't move on with
the day without knowing I've done it. It's an easy code, Wordle. I did it once for just this everday CSA assignment and just moved on.
Yet nevertheless, this is what I need on the daily basis.


# September 12, 2024

I think the instructions were perfect. I read them through for like 5 minutes and all of a sudden I made a perfect journal. The instructions are really clear, I think it's just user error as the problem.
It'd be a lot of hassle, but maybe add pictures so we can see what our screen is supossed to look like after everything. Again, the directions were crystal clear, I couldn't make them better if I tried. It's really just user-error that's the main problem.

Things like for-loops, if-statements, data types, and variables are absolute game changers for coding. Prior to these, coding is just a block of code, taking something and returning something. But with the ability to do logic, it changes the entire environment and nature behind coding.
We can use for-loops to iterate through a list, and pair it with if-statements to make powerful sorting and selection systems. Things like Merge Sort and Binary Sort would be impossible, or atleast cancerous, without logic like this. Logic is what turned coding from a little poor baby to an
effectual powerhouse, capable of doing anything.
