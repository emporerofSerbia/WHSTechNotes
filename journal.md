Everyday for to start off my morning, I play wordle. It's not good for me, I know that much, but its latched onto me. I can't move on with
the day without knowing I've done it. It's an easy code, Wordle. I did it once for just this everday CSA assignment and just moved on.
Yet nevertheless, this is what I need on the daily basis.

I think the instructions were perfect. I read them through for like 5 minutes and all of a sudden I made a perfect journal. The instructions are really clear, I think it's just user error as the problem.
It'd be a lot of hassle, but maybe add pictures so we can see what our screen is supossed to look like after everything. Again, the directions were crystal clear, I couldn't make them better if I tried. It's really just user-error that's the main problem.

Things like for-loops, if-statements, data types, and variables are absolute game changers for coding. Prior to these, coding is just a block of code, taking something and returning something. But with the ability to do logic, it changes the entire environment and nature behind coding.
We can use for-loops to iterate through a list, and pair it with if-statements to make powerful sorting and selection systems. Things like Merge Sort and Binary Sort would be impossible, or atleast cancerous, without logic like this. Logic is what turned coding from a little poor baby to an
effectual powerhouse, capable of doing anything.
