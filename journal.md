We might be celebrating Thanksgiving next week, but only maybe. I personally bomb an orphanage every Thanksgiving so that the children can be thankful before I take EVERYTHING away. But in popular
culture, Thanksgiving is coming.

1. A U.S airliner was struck by gunfire while going over Haitian borders. This relates to our class because had their data-solving, enemy bomber analyzer been working, it wouldn't have tried to fire down a U.S comercial airline.
2. Things like A.I could utylize adaptive pattern recognition to find out what is safe and what isn't, being reliable even through the test of time.

1. It's vital to protect your information when publishing online. Your sensitive information can be used against you to access things like your bank account, social security, and do reveal private things you don't want revealed.
2. Steps taken to prevent the release of your personal data are things like a password. Multi-factor authentification especially is a great way to ensure your account won't be hacked for a long time.
3. This one time I shared with my friends a picture of this dog, but my feet were in frame. They took screenshot after screenshot, and even after i deleted the picture, my feet may never be truely secret again.
4. Balancing being open while still keeping your htings private can be achieved with things like a public account. The account will only have things you don't really care if they get hacked. No secret passwords, private anything in the account, so that you can use it freely without fear if getting exposed.

Technology could greatly expand the reach that polling could go. Instead of having to put a station with police, a secure ticket stand, and a million ways to make sure people don't sneak in multiple tickets, we coudl have just throw down a polling booth and call it a day. The algorithm can be tried and tried again to be infallible, it's way cheaper, and can make accurately counting the vote way easier. However, scams and hacking become a big fear with this. Many people have accused the 2016 and 2020 elections robbed, with both sides fearing the other interefering with the machines.

AI will be a major help to programmers. Why make an entire least to greatest sorting code when ai can just copy and paste it in for you. It'll make all the typing a lot faster. We can mold it to our needs and make it perfect for everything we want
AI in the job market will slash the demand for our volume of programmers. Since makign the simple code is now easy, only the best of the best are needed for real algorithms an AI can't do yet. And with time, as AI gets better, the need for
more programmers will reach a bell curve.

1. Coding majorly helps problem solving through it's need for creative thinking. The basics of code are easy, but very just not human. If you wanna reverse a string or make palindromes, you're gonna have to make full use of your for-loops,
   and being to use them with full understanding. There's never a straight forward, one-step solution.
2. Knowing code helps you underatdn how the computer and software probably works. You can work with it when making spreadsheets, or even code your owb systems to automate your work.
3. Coding requires people to come together and think of genuinly insane way to solve problems. It needs that creativity, to use your crude tools to solve real world problems.

1. Web developer
2. Create use and ergodynamic web sites for people
3. Bachelors degree, computer science degree, heavy experience and good home projects
4.  Bachelors degree, computer science degree, heavy experience and good home projects
5.  Expected growth of around 10% in ten years
6.  I like making intuitive and easy to use things, I like webistes in general, and i think we have a need for better ones.

Code isn't human. To talk to the machine, you need to language EXACTLY like how it wants. There can be no ambiguous, no unclear basis
that a human could just assume over. Following instruction exactly as they are given is vital to learning how to code. There are many ways to teach, but there is only really one exact thing to teach. English classes differ from America to Britain, each with their own slang and vernacular, but in coding, there is only one, PRECISE language.

Everyday for to start off my morning, I play wordle. It's not good for me, I know that much, but its latched onto me. I can't move on with
the day without knowing I've done it. It's an easy code, Wordle. I did it once for just this everday CSA assignment and just moved on.
Yet nevertheless, this is what I need on the daily basis.

I think the instructions were perfect. I read them through for like 5 minutes and all of a sudden I made a perfect journal. The instructions are really clear, I think it's just user error as the problem.
It'd be a lot of hassle, but maybe add pictures so we can see what our screen is supossed to look like after everything. Again, the directions were crystal clear, I couldn't make them better if I tried. It's really just user-error that's the main problem.

Things like for-loops, if-statements, data types, and variables are absolute game changers for coding. Prior to these, coding is just a block of code, taking something and returning something. But with the ability to do logic, it changes the entire environment and nature behind coding.
We can use for-loops to iterate through a list, and pair it with if-statements to make powerful sorting and selection systems. Things like Merge Sort and Binary Sort would be impossible, or atleast cancerous, without logic like this. Logic is what turned coding from a little poor baby to an
effectual powerhouse, capable of doing anything.
