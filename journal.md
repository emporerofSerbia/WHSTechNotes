Things like for-loops, if-statements, data types, and variables are absolute game changers for coding. Prior to these, coding is just a block of code, taking something and returning something. But with the ability to do logic, it changes the entire environment and nature behind coding.
We can use for-loops to iterate through a list, and pair it with if-statements to make powerful sorting and selection systems. Things like Merge Sort and Binary Sort would be impossible, or atleast cancerous, without logic like this. Logic is what turned coding from a little poor baby to an
effectual powerhouse, capable of doing anything.
