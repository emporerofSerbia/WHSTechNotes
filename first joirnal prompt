PROPMT: how can i make the journal instructions better?

I think the instructions were perfect. I read them through for like 5 minutes and all of a sudden I made a perfect journal. The instructions are really clear, I think it's just user error as the problem.
It'd be a lot of hassle, but maybe add pictures so we can see what our screen is supossed to look like after everything. Again, the directions were crystal clear, I couldn't make them better if I tried. It's really just user-error that's the main problem.
